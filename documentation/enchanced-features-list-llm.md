# Enhanced Interactive Fiction System Features (LLM-Driven)

## Backend

### LLM Integration and Narrative Generation
- **LLM API Integration:**  
  - Connect to a GPT/LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, local model endpoint) using secure API keys or credentials.
- **Dynamic Prompt Construction:**  
  - Generate and assemble prompts using player context, previous passages, player choices, and world state.
  - Maintain templates for different narrative scenarios (e.g., introductions, scene descriptions, dialogue responses).
- **Response Handling and Formatting:**  
  - Parse model responses and clean/format the text to integrate seamlessly into the story.
  - Handle model response length, truncation, and retries if the model returns invalid or incomplete responses.

### World State and Context Management
- **Global State Tracking:**  
  - Store a global "world state" that evolves as the player moves through the story, influenced by their choices.
- **Player Inventory and Attributes:**  
  - Track player attributes (e.g., health, reputation) and inventory items, passing these details into LLM prompts.
- **Dynamic Variables in Prompts:**  
  - Dynamically include character names, recent narrative events, or player attributes in prompts to create coherent continuity.

### Conversation and Memory Handling
- **Persistent Model Context:**  
  - Maintain a conversation history or compressed narrative summary in the backend to ensure continuity in the generated story.
- **Selective Context Window:**  
  - Determine which past passages and player actions are most relevant and include them in the prompt for each new generation.
- **Context Compression and Summarization:**  
  - Periodically summarize past narrative states to fit within LLM context limits, ensuring long-term coherence without losing key plot points.

### Choice Generation and Adaptation
- **On-the-Fly Choice Creation:**  
  - Generate new sets of possible player actions dynamically, rather than selecting from a fixed choice list.
- **Choice Validation and Filtering:**  
  - Apply rules to ensure generated choices are actionable, relevant, and do not break the game’s logic or setting.

### Dynamic Story Branching and Plot Management
- **Automated Plot Structuring:**  
  - Define high-level plot arcs or objectives for the LLM to follow when generating scenes.
- **Goal-Based Generation:**  
  - Provide the LLM with narrative “goals” (e.g., reach a certain plot point) and let it generate intermediate steps.
- **Feedback Loops for Quality:**  
  - Implement scoring or heuristic checks on the LLM’s output to ensure narrative quality, consistency, and relevance.

### Backend Code Organization
- **Modular Prompt Functions:**  
  - Create dedicated functions to build prompts for different narrative needs (scene setting, conflict resolution, puzzle hints).
- **Flexible LLM Handlers:**  
  - Abstract LLM calls behind a single interface, allowing swapping between different model providers or local models.

## Frontend

### Real-Time Generation Feedback
- **Loading Indicators:**  
  - Display a loading animation while waiting for LLM-generated passages.
- **Error Handling UI:**  
  - Show user-friendly messages if the model fails to respond or times out.

### Dynamic Narrative Display
- **Auto-Updating Passages:**  
  - Refresh the passage content dynamically after the LLM returns the generated text.
- **Highlighted Changes:**  
  - Indicate newly generated content vs. previously viewed passages, helping users see what’s new.

### Interactive Choice Generation
- **Contextual Choices:**  
  - Display a dynamically generated set of actions or dialogue options after each passage.
- **Adaptive UI Elements:**  
  - Update choice buttons or menus based on player state and recent narrative events.

### Player Customization
- **Name and Character Creation:**  
  - Let players define their character name, background, or attributes up front, and pass these into prompts for personalized narrative.
- **Configurable Story Parameters:**  
  - Allow players to choose difficulty or complexity settings that alter prompt construction (e.g., simpler language, shorter responses, more frequent action scenes).

## Backend and LLM-Specific Features

### Prompt Engineering and Templates
- **Named Prompt Templates:**  
  - Maintain a library of prompt templates tailored to different narrative needs (scene setting, conflict resolution, puzzle hints).
- **Dynamic Slot-Filling in Prompts:**  
  - Replace placeholders in prompts with current state variables (e.g., {player_name}, {current_location}, {inventory_items}).

### AI Safety and Content Filtering
- **Model Response Filtering:**  
  - Implement a post-processing step to filter out unwanted or disallowed content before displaying to the user.
- **User-Adjustable Content Settings:**  
  - Allow players to enable/disable mature content filters or choose a “tone” for the narrative (e.g., lighthearted, serious).

### Scalability and Performance
- **Caching Model Results:**  
  - Cache certain generated responses if the player backtracks or revisits a state, reducing repeated requests.
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  - Implement request throttling to avoid exceeding API rate limits or slowing down the story for the player.

### Database and Data Structures
- **Expanded Data Models:**  
  - Store and update detailed player and world state records in the database.
- **Prompt and Response Logs:**  
  - Keep a history of prompts and responses for debugging, analytics, and improving prompt engineering.

## Player Progress and Continuity

### Narrative Persistence
- **Player Save/Load System:**  
  - Allow players to save their current narrative “snapshot” and load it later, reconstructing model context as needed.
- **Versioned Narrative States:**  
  - Keep multiple saved states or “bookmarks” in the story, letting players revisit key moments.

### In-Session Context Preservation
- **Session-Based Memory:**  
  - Store recent prompts and responses in the user’s session for immediate continuity between turns.
- **Long-Term Story Data:**  
  - Compress old narrative data and store summaries for long-term continuity even if the session is closed and reopened.

## User Interface and Interaction Enhancements

### Enhanced Choice Interaction
- **Branching Dialogue Trees:**  
  - Represent multiple layers of conversation choices dynamically generated by the LLM.
- **Previewing Consequences:**  
  - (Future Feature) Allow the model to hint at possible outcomes of choices to guide player decisions.

### Accessibility and UX Improvements
- **Adaptive Difficulty:**  
  - The LLM can simplify descriptions or provide hints if the player is stuck.
- **Narration Styles:**  
  - Offer toggleable narration styles (e.g., first-person, third-person, omniscient) by adjusting prompt templates.

## Additional AI-Driven Features

### Player Modeling
- **Personalized Storytelling:**  
  - The LLM adapts its narrative style based on the player’s past choices, preferred actions, or narrative pacing.
- **Emotion and Mood Tracking:**  
  - Track emotional states of characters and reflect them in generated content.

### Continuous Improvement and Training
- **Feedback Loops:**  
  - Let players rate generated passages or report issues, refining prompt templates and model usage over time.
- **Adaptive Prompting:**  
  - Dynamically adjust prompt construction rules based on observed model behavior and player feedback.

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Interactions:**  
  - Integrate multiple LLM “characters” that converse with each other and the player.
- **Procedural World Generation:**  
  - Have the model generate entire locations, maps, or NPCs on demand, further reducing pre-scripted content.
- **Offline/Local LLM Integration:**  
  - Allow running a local model for users who prefer not to use external API endpoints.
